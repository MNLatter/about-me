      <p>Hello, My name is Michael! I am 25 years young living in Vancouver, Wasgington. Before I started learning at CodeFellows I served 4 years in the Marine Corps as a metal worker. I welded all sorts of heavy equipment and even got certified to operate a few! Welding and pushing dirt was fun while I was in, but I knew I wanted to pursue something different. After my schoolwork is finished I pass the time by playing video games, playing soccer, or eating cake (I don't really eat cake for fun).</p>
